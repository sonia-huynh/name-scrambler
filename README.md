This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Name Scrmblr
- For me and my friend's birthday we decided our friends should dress as  each other, so I  created this quick app which randomly assigns each person a friend to dress as and sends it to them as an email :)

- Check out the deployed app here: https://name-scrmblr.vercel.app/
